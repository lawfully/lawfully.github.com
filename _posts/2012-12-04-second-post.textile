I was thinking what should I do with this, and kind of decided (subconsciously at least) to put it aside for a while.  

Which I did, of course.  It wasn't particularly difficult if you ask me, but I couldn't just let it pass along like this.  It's my character, I guess.  

Now, I want to try things out.  I could practice my writing or write about something which would be interesting to others.  I'm still thinking what that would be.

In the meantime, I changed my mac mini.  It's an old macmini3.1, dubbed *early 2009* but since I've upgraded it to 8G memory and 1G HD (just because I didn't want to pull the thing apart yet another time) and it works charm.  It's amazing to see what a little more memory can do.
