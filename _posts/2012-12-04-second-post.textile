I was thinking what should I do with this, and kind of decided (subconsciously at least) to put it aside for a while.  

Which I did, of course.  It wasn't particularly difficult if you ask me, but I couldn't just let it pass along like this.  It's my character, I guess.  

Now, I want to try things out.  I could practice my writing or write about something which would be interesting to others.  I'm still thinking what that would be.
